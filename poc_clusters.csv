4. using dynamic providers when managing landingzones? sure but what happens when your not suppose to onboard some accounts yet? blacklist those accounts? its better to declare/whitelist than to blacklist as the later is counter intuitive. sure its easier to do dynamic jsut fire and forget but being more intentful with accounts goes a long way especially when managing bigger accounts. its easy to add and remove accounts as part of normal lifecycle, sure onboarding is a pain cos you have to declare all accounts.
5. try going env vars as first class citizen, what i mean is use env vars to declare profile or accounts. this makes your provider block very basic. this works really well when using workspaces. cos you have clear demarcation of where you are running your code. pipelining becomes easy cos you just change the value of env vars depending on the account you targetting. once yo ustart needing to access other accounts then remember #3.",0,"cloud, deployment, data, azure, aws, infrastructure, mlops"
